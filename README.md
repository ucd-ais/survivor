## Jeff Probst is a desperate man.

"I'm gearing up for Season 41 of Survivor. A significant part of this process is participating in dozens of pre-season press conferences and interviews. During these I talk as much about past seasons as I do about the current season. With 40 seasons in the bag, it's frequently a struggle to keep my facts straight.

"A few months ago, I decided I wanted a web app that would place info about past and future seasons at my fingertips. I hired a friend's nephew to write the app for me. In some ways, he did an adequate job. In other ways ... I don't know what the knucklehead was thinking.

"I am getting on a plane to Fiji in a little over an hour. I need two important additions made to the app before I go:

1. The app displays season number, title, location, and original tribes. The original developer forgot a very important column: WINNERS!  Can you add a <strong>Winner</strong> column to the app? I can get my secretary to key in winner names later.
2. The app allows me to edit past season information but I can't add the new season!  Can you add a button or something so I can?  I want to add Season 41 information as soon as possible. I'll want to add future seasons as information becomes available.

"I'm not looking for anything polished. I just need something that works. I'll settle for partially works. Gary, Jeff and Aravindan will walk you through the app as it currently stands and will answer any questions you may have that they feel are appropriate for them to answer.

"Wanna know what you're coding for?

"How about the opportunity to join a small, friendly, cohesive team of developers, doing interesting work for decent pay? 

"Worth coding for? If so, let's get started!"
